						<h2 style="color:#9b9da0;">Growing up, I played 3 different sports including football, basketball, and baseball. Although I was better at baseball, the love I had for basketball has always been above all. As I got serious about basketball I started to think of it as not just a game, but a lifestyle. Basketball has opened so many doors for me and is the reason that I'm going to college for free. I plan on continuing to out work everybody and make it to the NBA in the future. This will not be easy but I am willing to work endlessly for this. Basketball is my world. </h2>
